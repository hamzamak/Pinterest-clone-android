- The module components handled by a teacher may belong to one or more courses.
- The evaluation methods are CC (continuous control), TP (practical work), project presentations, etc.
- Each module component has one or more evaluation methods (such as CC, TP, and Project) each with a coefficient (CC: 30%, TP: 20%, Project: 50%).
- A teacher handles module components.
- Each teacher has a login account for the application.
- The application profiles are the administrator and the teacher.

The application must also ensure data privacy and confidentiality by providing secure login authentication and access control.
